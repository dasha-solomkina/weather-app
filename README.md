# Weather App
This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in using APIs and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. The primary objective was to create a weather forecast site that allows users to search for a specific location and display weather data in Fahrenheit or Celsius. This project was completed as part of the course: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app). The code was written independently, based on the concepts studied in the course.

## Key Features
- **Search Location**: Allows users to search for weather data for a specific location.
- **Temperature Toggle**: Users can toggle between displaying the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- **Dynamic UI**: The look of the page changes based on the weather data, including background color and weather-related images or gifs.
- **API Integration**: Fetches weather data from the WeatherAPI.
- **Tools**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WeatherAPI.
